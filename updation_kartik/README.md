# Jarvis Application Improvement

## Update: Enhanced Error Handling and Security

This update improves the main Jarvis application (`Jarvis.py`) with:

### Key Improvements:
1. **Robust Error Handling**: Added comprehensive try-catch blocks to prevent application crashes
2. **Logging System**: Integrated proper logging for debugging and monitoring
3. **Safe Secret Access**: Created `safe_get_secret()` function to handle missing configuration gracefully
4. **Modular Design**: Separated authenticated page building into dedicated function
5. **Fallback Navigation**: Provides minimal functionality if critical errors occur

### Security Enhancements:
- Prevents application crashes from configuration issues
- Logs security-related errors without exposing sensitive information
- Graceful degradation when secrets are missing

### Usage:
Replace the current `Jarvis.py` with `improved_main_app.py` to implement these improvements.

### Benefits:
- Better user experience with informative error messages
- Easier debugging with structured logging
- More resilient application that handles edge cases
- Improved security through safer secret handling
